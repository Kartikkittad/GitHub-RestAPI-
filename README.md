GitHub Repositories Viewer is a web application that allows users to explore GitHub repositories associated with a specific GitHub profile. The application displays the user's profile picture, name, location, follower count, and a link to their GitHub profile. Additionally, it showcases a list of repositories with details like repository name, description, and the programming languages used. The user can navigate through the repositories using a pagination feature. The application also provides information extracted from the user's bio, including social media links.

If you are having issues like "username not found" its due to GitHub API Rate limit.
